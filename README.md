# Job Compass -Job Recommendation and Skill Enhancing Guide
Job Compass: Job Recommendation & Skill Enhancing Guide aims to provide personalized job recommendations and skill enhancement strategies using fuzzy logic, helping users make informed career decisions and align their skills with market demands. 

The core of the recommendation system is the fuzzy inference mechanism. Utilizing the scikit-fuzzy library, we developed a fuzzy logic model that considers various user inputs—such as skill rankings—and processes them to yield tailored job recommendations. This stage involved defining membership functions and rules to accommodate the subjectivity of user responses.

The user interface was designed using the Tkinter library to ensure a visually appealing and intuitive experience. Key elements included dropdown menus for skill ranking, buttons for submission, and dynamic feedback displays for job recommendations and skill assessments. Special attention was given to styling and usability to enhance user engagement.

To facilitate better understanding, Matplotlib was incorporated to generate visualizations of skill contributions and job recommendations. Graphs and charts were created to represent how user skills align with job profiles, allowing users to visualize their potential career paths and areas for improvement.

A comprehensive knowledge base was developed, detailing job profiles, associated skills, and suggested courses for skill enhancement. This resource serves as a foundation for the recommendations generated by the fuzzy inference system, ensuring that users receive accurate and relevant guidance.
